      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Weddingvia.com™ is committed to protecting your privacy. This Cookie
        Policy explains what cookies are, what types of cookies are placed on
        your device when you visit our website and how we use them.This Cookie
        Policy does not explain how we deal with your personal information. To

      <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web
        browser or your device's memory. A cookie typically contains the name of
        the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the
        "lifetime" of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly
        generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain
        information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history
        and activities conducted while using our services.
      </p>

      <h3>Are there different types of cookies?</h3>
      <strong>First-party and third-party cookies</strong>
      <p>
        There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party
        cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use
        first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser's language
        preferences and to better understand your use of our website.
        Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and
        service providers. For example, we use third-party cookies to measure
        user numbers on our website or to enable you to share content with
        others across social media platforms.
      </p>
      <strong>Session and persistent cookies</strong>
      <p>
        There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only
        last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety
        of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during
        one single browser session and to help you to use our website more
        efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and aren't
        automatically deleted when you close your browser. These types of
        cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign-in to our website
        again and for analytical purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h3>
      <p>
        Other technologies such as web beacons (also calls pixel tags or clear
        gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for
        similar purposes. Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a
        unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited
        our service or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. Tracking URLs
        are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to
        our web pages comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in
        apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.
      </p>
      <p>
        For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as "cookies" in this
        Cookie Policy.
      </p>
